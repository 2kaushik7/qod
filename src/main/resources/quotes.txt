Baba is eternal
Entering Shirdi will save you from all odds
Dwarakamai will bless everyone equally
I rescue by disciples from my grave
My human body talks to everyone from my grave
It is my responsibility to rescue Who seeks shelter from me
I will bless who focuses on me
I carry your problems if you focus on me
If you seek advice or help I always there for you
My disciples will never run out of food and shelter
I will accomplish everything from my grave
